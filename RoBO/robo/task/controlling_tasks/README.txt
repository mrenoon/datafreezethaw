Important:

Make sure you have pymatbridge installed and that walker_simulation.m is added in the WGCCM_three_link_walker_example folder.

walker_simulation.m makes use of the simulator's functions and act as a bridge between RoBo and simulator.

The needed simulator (WGCCM_three_link_walker_example.zip) can be found in http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~grizzle/biped_book_web/ Â©Professor Jessy Grizzle, University of Michigan, Professor Eric Westervelt, The Ohio State University, and Mr. Ben Morris, University of Michigan.

Simply add the needed paths (matlab file and simulation) into the python file.
